        author: "Agatha Christie",
        content: "Agatha Christie worked in a pharmacy during World War I. This gave her deep knowledge of medicines and toxins, which she used to create realistic (and very clever) poison-related plots in her mysteries. In 1926, Christie herself mysteriously disappeared for 11 days, sparking a nationwide search. To this day, the full truth behind her disappearance is unknown."

        content: "Wrote much of the first Harry Potter book in cafés because she couldn’t afford heating at home. She was rejected by 12 publishers before Bloomsbury finally accepted the manuscript.

        content: "Rented hotel rooms by the month just to write in peace—she removed all decorations to focus.

Her autobiography I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings was one of the first widely read books to openly discuss racism and trauma."

        author: "Mark Twein",
        content: "Published all her novels anonymously during her lifetime—her books were simply credited to “A Lady”.

        author: "Franz Kafka",
        content: "Worked as an insurance clerk by day and wrote his surreal fiction at night. Asked for all his unpublished manuscripts to be burned after his death—fortunately, his friend Max Brod ignored him, preserving classics like The Trial. Was extremely shy and rarely read his work aloud in public."
